# tkinter_tic_tac_toe.py

This file displays the code of the tic-tac-toe written in python. In a difference to the tic_tac_toe.py the interface is done using tkinter. By constructing the GUI (graphical interface) the code changes and it is now event driven. In other words the flow of the program is determined by the action of pressing a button.

The interface looks like this:
